# CS6120 Implementation Tasks Spring 2025

Lesson 2 tasks: Create a new benchmark for Bril + make a small program to analyze/transform Bril programs.

To running lesson_2_tasks/program_analysis.ts : need resolveJsonModule and esModuleInterop flags in command

Lesson 3 tasks: Implement trivial dead code elimination and local value numbering.
Apparently I basically did the first part in my lesson 2 implementation lolz
did in typescript since i've been mainly working in TS the past few weeks, probably
switching for next task though (i just really didn't feel like setting anything else up)
