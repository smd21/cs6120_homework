# CS6120 Implementation Tasks Spring 2025

Lesson 2 tasks: Create a new benchmark for Bril + make a small program to analyze/transform Bril programs.

Some background: Last semester I took 4414 and the final assignment was to implement basic math functions for large integers represented as arrays (1 digit per index). I had a small bug early on that resulted in a massive headache towards the end of the assignment. I am really not proud of the work I did (I ran out of time and had to cobble something working together), so I decided to take revenge on the assignment and re-implement a piece of it as my benchmark for Bril.
